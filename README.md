# Bootstrap

Bootstrap 3 is a widely used CSS (and JS) framework, in fact it has been so overused that nowadays, a website which only uses it generally looks _cheap_.

The framework can be, however, really useful to organize layouts and can be tweaked in depth if you use the [less](http://lesscss.org/) CSS pre-processor.

Since a few years, a new version of Bootstrap is in preparation.
This new version does not use the less pre-processor but rather
[sass](http://sass-lang.com/).

## Steps

### Preparation

Fork and this repository and clone it locally.

### Adding `class` attributes

Once cloned you will find a folder called `screenshots` with 2 images (`wide.png` and `narrow.png`).

Add the `class` attributes to the `index.html` go reproduce the layout of `wide.png`.

Once the layout matches the `wide.png` add the additional classes (they are only 2) so that when you reduce the width of your viewport (narrowing) it also matches the layout of `narrow.png`.

__Note:__ you should not change anything else than adding the `class` attributes.
